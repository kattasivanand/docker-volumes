steps:
create a docker server.
  and install (docker) yum install docker -y
  start docker deamon command is 
  systemctl start docker
  systemctl status docker
  --> now we can do docker volumes.
  what is docker volume?
  --> it is used to store data inside container
  --> volume is a simple directory inside container
  -->container uses host resources like (cpu,ram,rom)
  -->single volume can be shared to multiple containers
  at a time we can share single volume to single container.
  every volume will store under
  /var/lib/docker/volumes
  -->to create docker volume we have n number of methods
  1.Dockerfile
  2.FROM CLI
  3.VOLUME MOUNTING
  process:
  Now create a dockerfile.
  command is vim Dockerfile
  after you write inside docker file
  FROM ubuntu
  VOLUME ["/volume1]
          volume1 is you chocice you can take any name
  -->now dockerfile is completed
          when dockerfile is done we can to build
          command is docker build -t siva:v1
          now you can create container.
          command is docker run -it --name cont1 siva:v1
          now it goes insde container.
          give ls it shows volumes is volume1
          i am going volume1-->cd volume1
          crating files touch file{1..5}
          now files in inside cotainer.
-->Now i want to share volume1 to cont2
          create a contaoner
          command is docker run -it --name cont2 --volumes-from cont1 ubuntu
          now give ls there is volume1
          go inside volume1 cd volume1
          then give ll
          what ever cont1 data the coming to cont2
-->if i am modifing data cont2 then it will replicas to cont1 because the volume is same
